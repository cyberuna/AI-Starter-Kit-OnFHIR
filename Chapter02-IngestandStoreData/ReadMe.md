# Chapter02 - Ingest and Store Data

#### This chapter shows how to setup Azure API for FHIR, and setup Azure Function and Azure Blob Storage to ingest data.

[FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/) standard is a new schema for US Healthcare that enables universal interoperability of EHR. FHIR ensures that data is stored in a consistent format and uses unique identifiers to connect it to related patient data so it is organized into structured data points.

[Azure API for FHIR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/) is a managed, standards-based, compliant API for clinical health data that enables solutions for actionable analytics and machine learning.
The Azure API for FHIR ingests, normalizes, secures and stores data with auditing and access controls. Data can then be easily connected together and shared.

## Deploy using [QuickStart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir-paas-portal-quickstart).

## Deploy using [Step by Step Instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenHack-FHIR/tree/main/Challenge01-AzureAPIforFHIR) to Ingest, Load, Store and Query data.
