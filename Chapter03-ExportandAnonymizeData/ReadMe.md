# Chapter03 - Export and Anonymize Data

#### This chapter focuses on Exporting data from Azure API for FHIR, and Anonymizing that data. 

The FHIR Export with Anonymization is a template for creating an automated pipeline to process the bulk export for FHIR using Azure tools. The goal of the template is to enable quick and continuous creation of research datasets while applying HIPAA safe harbor rules.

The template connects multiple tools from the Microsoft Health Cloud and Data Team together into an automated solution. The two main components are:
   * Bulk Export or $export
   * FHIR Tools for Anonymization

### Deploy using [Step by Step Instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenHack-FHIR/tree/main/Challenge03-ExportandAnonymizeData) to Export and Anonymize data.
